# ContentBoard

--A small project i have created for my practice.

--created a content board which basically perform the operation like.

--create new post , edit the post, delete the post.

--i have done these opertaion using the concept of express and restful api.

--also by using some extra library of node like for creating new id every time i am using "UUID4()", and for using function like PATCH and DELETE in html forms and sending the request i have use "method-override".

--also have used the concept EJS and many of its functions for that. 



(in short if i talk that why i have created this small project is just to revise and practice my concept of ejs and restful api)
